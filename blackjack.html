  Ener a bet: <input type="number" min="0" id="bet" value="0"><br>

  <br> <br> <br>

  <p>
    How to play:<br>
    Enter a new bet and press New Game.  If you press New Game in the middle of the game, you will forfeit your bet.<br>
    As long as your hand does not exceed 21 you may press hit for a new card.  If you're happy with your hand, you can press Stand <br>
    and the dealer will go.  The dealer must hit until 17 and doesn't have to hit on a soft 17.  You may bet more money than you currently have.<br>
    However, you will go into the hole.  Excessive amount of time spent in the hole will result in a visit from the mafia.
